		<h2>Tail Lights</h2>
		<p class="years">Written July 2007</p>
		<p>A sea of red<br/>
		tail lights<br/>
		ahead of me<br/>
		mocking<br/>
		my desire<br/>
		to get home<br/>
		early.</p>
		
		<p>And my mind wanders&hellip;</p>
		
		<p>Past midnight when the moon was new,<br/>
		the sky blanketed by thick clouds<br/>
		blocking out even the brightest star.<br/>
		In this unlit, shadowless world<br/>
		a horse drew a small wagon<br/>
		along a barely visible trail<br/>
		through the wilderness.</p>
		
		<p>No tail lights ahead then.</p>
