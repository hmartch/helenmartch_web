		<h2>And Then, I Became a Mother</h2>
		<p class="years">Written May 2010</p>
		<p>My husband and I married when I was thirty years old. We had known each other and had been dating for over six years by the time we married. At that time of the wedding, I was going to graduate school full-time and working various part-time jobs. My husband worked full-time and had a fairly long commute. It was not on our minds to start a family right away.</p>
<p>We'd been married for almost a year when I finished my degree. I was lucky and quickly got an exciting new job with a young company. I was only their second employee hired. I also had the opportunity to teach an undergraduate course at my old school and also to help define and teach a new continuing education program the school was offering. My husband also was advancing into new responsibilities in his job. Life was busy. It was not on our minds to start a family yet.</p>
<p>Another year passed. The demands of the teaching positions became too much with the increasing work in my day job so I stopped teaching. My company was growing, bringing on more new employees and taking on bigger, more challenging projects. The company outgrew the little office space in the trendy part of town and moved to a larger, more traditional, office building downtown. Things seemed to be getting more solid, more stable. My husband and I began to think about someday wanting to start a family. We thought we should buy a house.</p>
<p>After a few months of searching, visiting available properties, and considering possible locations, we found a home that we liked and could afford. It was in a good town that had good schools. It was close to public transportation and had some nice features like a big garage, a nice yard and a full basement. We paid the deposits and signed the papers and got the keys. We were home owners.</p>
<p>We picked out colors for the living room, dining room and kitchen. We painted the living room and dining room ourselves before moving in, but decided the kitchen would be a bit harder and that we'd wait and hire someone to do that. We packed up everything at our old apartment. The movers came and we watched as they loaded up our life to move it to our new home. In hardly any time, we were in our new place, exhausted but happy. We still weren't ready to start a family yet, but this was the first step.</p>
<p>About two weeks later, the bosses at my job called a company meeting.  It seemed that they had expanded the company too fast and taken on more expenses than the income from the client contracts. They were not going to be able to pay us at the next pay day and maybe not for a while after that. I was stunned. We'd just bought a house! Signed a thirty-year mortgage! We'd painted! The bosses talked about options for the future and some people chose to stay, without pay, to try to help work past the problems and get the company's finances stabilized. I didn't feel that I could do that. I wished them luck but I chose to leave. This was no time to even think about starting a family.</p>
<p>My husband helped me brush up my r&eacute;sum&eacute; and I got signed up with a variety of recruiter companies and temp agencies. I was determined to get a job as quickly as I could. I was lucky. Two weeks later I was starting in a new job. It was initially to be only a temporary, freelance position, both from the employer's perspective and my own. The responsibilities weren't quite what I thought I ultimately wanted to do, though I had the skills to do the work. It didn't take long though for me to get comfortable in the environment. I liked my co-workers. And I came to, mostly, like the work. So, when about a month later, my boss said that they'd like to offer me a full-time, permanent staff position I decided that was something that I wanted to do (particularly, when I was able to negotiate up the salary a bit.) Life became more stable once again. But the sudden nature of what had happened at my last job had shaken me. I wasn't ready to take on anything else new in life. My husband agreed. It was not the time for us to start a family; that was certain.</p>
<p>Time passed. Both of us were very busy with work. Both of us were not always happy with our jobs. We weren't specifically talking about future plans for starting a family. It wasn't really on our minds. We were busy with other things. We learned to scuba dive and took a nice vacation to finish our certification. We worked on our garden. We did lots of things that a married couple without children could do.  Then, I read an article in Time magazine and my perspective changed completely. It was a story called "Making Time for a Baby" and was about age-related infertility. It included a quote which said, "27 is the age at which a woman's chance of getting pregnant begins to decline." I was thirty-four years old. That story made me feel like my time could be running out. But I still wasn't sure if I felt ready. I didn't say anything to my husband yet. I thought about things but before long my focus moved back to other thoughts and concerns.</p>
<p>Then some months later, I saw a television program that included an interview with a woman who wrote the book on which the Time magazine article had largely been based. My fears and anxieties about my own "ticking clock" were renewed. This time I couldn't shake the feeling of being short on time. I talked with my husband. We decided to try to have a baby.</p>
<p>It turns out that I probably hadn't needed to be so concerned about my ability to conceive. Within two months from our decision, my doctor was telling me, "Congratulations. You're pregnant." My husband and I were thrilled.  We kept the news to ourselves for a while though. We decided not to tell anyone, not even our parents, not yet. It was our secret. And we weren't ready to share it.</p>
<p>Our son is now in the first grade. He loves pirates and dragons and dinosaurs. His favorite foods are peanut butter, chicken and macaroni and cheese... or maybe grilled cheese sandwiches, pizza and ice cream. It actually seems to depend on the day he's asked. His favorite color used to be red but now it's green. Recently, he said that he wants to be a security guard when he grows up, which is at least a real job; he used to say he wanted to be a super hero. He gets whiny when he's over-tired or over-hungry but won't admit it. He's silly and sweet and sometimes too hard on himself when he is having trouble while trying to do something new. And when you're six years old and in the first grade, there are a lot of things that are new. For that matter, when you're forty-two years old and you have a son in the first grade, there are a lot of things that are new too. So, our family is learning and growing together. I think we might be ready.</p>
