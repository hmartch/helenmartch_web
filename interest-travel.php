		<p>I have been traveling since I was a very young child. Family vacations and visits to relatives across the country were my earliest travel experiences. 
		As I got older, trips with my high school and college choir took me to additional places I'd not been before. Before college, when I went on a spring break 
		to the Bahamas with my girlfriends, the only other countries I'd been to had been Canada and Mexico. On our honeymoon, we went to Spain and we've been able 
		to do more traveling in other parts of the world since then.</p>
		<p>The below map shows in yellow the states in which I have traveled. Someday I hope to visit the rest of them.</p>

		<p>I have been to each of the U.S. Virgin Islands, St. Croix, St. Thomas, and my favorite, St. John.  And brief day visits to Tortuga of the British Virgin Islands.</p>
		<p>Countries which I have visited:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Mexico - Juarez, Cozumel, Playa del Carmen, the ruins at Coba</li>
			<li>Canada - Niagara Falls, Toronto, Windsor</li>
			<li>Bahamas - Nassau</li>
			<li>Germany - Honestly, only in airports in Frankfort and Munich, but I was in the country!</li>
			<li>Spain - Barcelona, briefly in Madrid (driving between train stations), Granada</li>
			<li>St. Lucia</li>
			<li>Italy - Rome</li>
			<li>Sicily - Messina</li>
			<li>Greece - Athens, Santorini</li>
			<li>Turkey - Izmir, Istanbul</li>
			<li>Malta</li>
			<li>Bermuda</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Some of the many other places that I'd like to see someday are England, Ireland, Scotland, China, Japan, Thailand, India, New Zealand, Australia, Egypt, Prague, Venice, Vienna, France, and many more.</p>
