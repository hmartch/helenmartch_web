		<h2>My Career Overview</h2>
		<section>
		<p>I have over fifteen years experience in web page development. I taught myself HTML and started freelance work on web projects in 1996. In the fall of 2000, I joined the staff of Oprah.com, holding various responsibilities as the needs of the site shifted over time. In my position as Senior Web Developer, I supervised the front-end development team while continuing to do hands-on development work.</p>
			
		<p>In 1999, I earned a Master's degree in Human-Computer Interaction from DePaul University. The primary focus of my studies was in the area of user-centered design. I am thoroughly convinced that the use of good design techniques is crucial to the usability and ultimate success of a product.</p>
		
		<p>My undergraduate degree is in Television/Radio/Film Production, which I studied at Syracuse University's Newhouse School of Communications. My coursework provided me with a broad knowledge of production procedures and techniques, many of which also apply to software and web development.</p>
		
		<p>After receiving my Bachelor's degree, I pursued my interest in television production. I developed an interest in interactive multimedia and how I might apply my production knowledge to this area. I took courses to further my education in multimedia techniques. My experiences in these courses led to my enrollment in the HCI program at DePaul.</p>
		
		<p>Upon completion of my Master's, I taught part-time for the university, while working full-time for HannaHodge, Inc. as an Interaction Designer. Unfortunately, the birth of HannaHodge coincided with the burst of the dot com bubble and the young company did not survive. That was when I joined the Oprah.com team.</p>

		<p>I worked on Oprah.com for nearly eleven years but as <i>The Oprah Winfrey Show</i> ended, I made my choice to move on. After taking a few months to enjoy some quality family time, I went back to work in February 2012 as a front-end development contractor for Sears Holdings Corporation. In the first few months, I worked on projects for a variety of business units and then I joined the team dedicated to the Sears Home Services online business unit.</p>
